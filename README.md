# 🧠 WasteClassificationCNN

An AICTE Virtual Internship (Cycle 3) project focused on **waste classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
This project helps identify and categorize waste into different types using image classification techniques, contributing towards environmental sustainability.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).

You can also download it programmatically using:

```python
import kagglehub  # You may need to run: pip install kagglehub

path = kagglehub.dataset_download("techsash/waste-classification-data")
print("Path to dataset files:", path)
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

We use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify waste images into categories like:

- Organic
- Recyclable

The model is trained on labeled images and evaluated using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.
